# Machine Learning and Statistics

Repository for the Tasks assessment for Machine Learning and Statistics module @ GMIT - 2020

Author: Maciej Izydorek Email: G00387873@gmit.ie Github: [mizydorek](https://github.com/mizydorek)

#

#### Tasks

*Four tasks will be listed here at different times during the semester. You should complete all tasks in a single jupyter notebook. This, along with relevant files like a README, should be in a single git repository synced with a hosting provider like GitHub [1]. That URL should then be submitted using the link on the Moodle page.*

1. Square root of 2
2. Chi-Square test
3. STDEV.p vs STDEV.S
4. K-means clustering on the iris dataset

#### Contents of repository

The repository contains:

* `README.md` file
* `numpy.random.ipynb` — jupyter notebook contains solution to the assignment
* `requirements.txt` — contains list of packages need to run the notebook
* `.gitignore` — contains list of files that have to be ignore
* `assessment.pdf` — contains the instructions for the Tasks assessment for Machine Learning and Statistics 

#### Required software

The following software is required to run the notebook:

* `git` — open source software to download the repository onto computer[3]
* `python` — Python Programming Language
* `Numpy. Pandas. SciPy. Matplotlib. Seaborn. Jupyter` — python packages used to make an investigation into the numpy.random package[5,6,7,8,9] 

* `Anaconda` — Individual edition of Anaconda can be install to get all of the relevant software.[4]

or alternatively the following command will install the packages according to the configuration file

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Instructions for downloading repository

At github repository [Machine Learning and Statistics](https://github.com/mizydorek/Machine-Learning-Tasks-2020) click on the green `Code` button to copy the link. Open command line(windows) or terminal(osx/linux), navigate to the selected directory and enter the command `git clone` folowed copied the URL. Alternatively copy the whole command below:

```
git clone https://github.com/mizydorek/Machine-Learning-Tasks-2020.git
```

The whole repository will be cloned down onto current working directory.

#### How to run the jupyter notebook

From there run `jupyter notebook` command on the command line/terminal. This will open Jupyter in the browser. The notebook containing solution that is called `numpy.random.ipynb` can be opened by clicking on it.
Once opened, select `Restart and Run All` from Kernel sub-menu to run the jupyter notebook.

#### Viewing the Notebook 

The notebook can be viewed online either on the [github](https://github.com/mizydorek/Machine-Learning-Tasks-2020/blob/main/tasks.ipynb) or by accessing through Jupyter Notebooks viewer  [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github.com/mizydorek/Machine-Learning-Tasks-2020/blob/main/tasks.ipynb).
